# Shellcheck configuration
# Disable specific checks that are not relevant for this project

# SC1091: Not following sourced files - expected in CI environment
disable=SC1091

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately - style preference, not critical
disable=SC2155

# SC2162: read without -r - minor issue, read behavior is acceptable
disable=SC2162

# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes - by design for git aliases
disable=SC2016

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing - intentional word splitting in some contexts
disable=SC2086

# SC2153: Possible misspelling - handled by variable definitions
disable=SC2153

# SC2129: Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file instead of individual redirects - style preference
disable=SC2129

# SC2034: Variable appears unused - may be used externally or in sourced scripts
disable=SC2034

# SC2126: Consider using 'grep -c' instead of 'grep|wc -l' - style preference
disable=SC2126

# SC1090: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source - dynamic sourcing expected
disable=SC1090

# SC2235: Use { ..; } instead of (..) to avoid subshell overhead - style preference
disable=SC2235

# SC2001: See if you can use ${variable//search/replace} instead - style preference
disable=SC2001

# SC2012: Use find instead of ls to better handle non-alphanumeric filenames - info level
disable=SC2012

# SC2181: Check exit code directly with e.g. 'if ! mycmd;', not indirectly with $? - style preference
disable=SC2181

# SC2087: Quote 'EOF' to make here document expansions happen on the server side - intentional design
disable=SC2087

# SC1037: Braces are required for positionals over 9 - false positive for dollar amounts in strings
disable=SC1037
